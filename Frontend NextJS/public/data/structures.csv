In vitro, flortaucipir F 18 binds to paired helical filament (PHF) tau purified from brain homogenates of donors with AD. The dissociation constant (Kd) of flortaucipir F 18 binding to PHFs is 0.57 nM. In vivo, flortaucipir F 18 is differentially retained in neocortical areas that contain aggregated tau.
